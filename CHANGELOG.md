# Changelog

## Unreleased (on main branch only)

- Internal refactoring to use an error struct and provide better errors

## 2024-05-06 v0.6.2

## 2024-05-05 v0.6.1

- Show project name when printing a task when the task was obtained through a filter (not a project)
- Add `timeout` argument
- Add `repeat` flag to `project remove`

## 2024-05-04 v0.6.0

- **BREAKING CHANGE** Rewrote the external API, both to make it more coherent for the end user and to make it easier to add to from a development perspective. No functionality lost. The main change is that instead of using the `project` or `filter` command for searching for lists of tasks, we now use the `list` command that can take either `--project` or `--filter` flags. This is a change needed to proceed with planned features.
- Added short commands for all subcommands and flags
