# Publish Checklist

## Setup `tod-bin`

Create `tod-bin` directory for pushing to AUR

```bash
./setup_aur.sh
```

## Publish to Cargo and AUR

This checklist is just here for me to reduce the friction of publishing new versions.

Code changes

1. Update dependencies and make sure nothing broke with `./update_test.sh`
2. Change version in `Cargo.toml`
3. Update CHANGELOG.md with version number
4. Update README.md with help text `cargo run -- -h`
5. Add any new examples to README.md
6. Open PR for version and wait for it to pass
7. Commit and merge PR

8. Build release

```bash
git checkout main
git pull
cargo aur
```

9. [Create a new release](https://github.com/alanvardy/tod/releases/new)

- Make sure to use the label and title in format `v0.3.8`
- Add binary from `tod` directory

10. Publish to Cargo with `cargo publish`
11. Push to AUR with `./push_aur.sh`
