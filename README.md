## Tod

[![Build Status](https://github.com/alanvardy/tod/workflows/ci/badge.svg)](https://github.com/alanvardy/tod) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/alanvardy/tod/branch/master/graph/badge.svg?token=9FBJK1SU0K)](https://codecov.io/gh/alanvardy/tod) [![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/tod.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/tod)

A tiny todoist CLI program. Takes simple input and dumps it in your inbox or another project. Tasks sent to the inbox can take advantage of natural language processing to assign due dates, tags etc.

Will ask for your [Todoist API token](https://todoist.com/prefs/integrations) on first run, and your data in json format in `~/.tod.cfg`.

Alan Vardy <alan@vardy.cc>
A tiny unofficial Todoist client

    tod [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
    -a, --add <PROJECT NAME> <PROJECT ID>
            Add a project to config with id

    -c, --complete
            Complete the last task fetched with next

    -e, --scheduled
            Returns items that are today and have a time. Can specify project option, defaults to
            inbox.

    -h, --help
            Print help information

    -l, --list
            List all the projects in local config

    -n, --next
            Get the next task by priority. Requires project option.

    -o, --config <CONFIGURATION PATH>
            Absolute path of configuration. Defaults to ~/.tod.cfg.

    -p, --project <PROJECT NAME>
            The project namespace, for filtering other commands, use by itself to list all tasks for the project

    -r, --remove <PROJECT NAME>
            Remove a project from config by name

    -s, --sort
            Sort inbox by moving tasks into projects

    -t, --task <new task>...

    -V, --version
            Print version information

    -z, --prioritize
            Assign priorities to tasks. Can specify project option, defaults to inbox.
```

- You will be asked for an API key on first login, which is stored in `~/.tod.cfg`
- Add your most commonly used projects, the project ID is the last serials of numbers in the URL. If the project name includes spaces, wrap the project name with quotes.
- You can use natural language processing such as dates priority etc when sending to inbox, but not to the projects due to current limitations.
- Items are ranked by points and the first is returned:
  - Item is overdue: 150
  - Date is today with no time: 100
  - Date is today with time in next or last 15 min: 200
  - No date: 80
  - Not recurring: 50
  - Item has no priority: 2
  - Priority 1: 1
  - Priority 2: 3
  - Priority 3: 4

#### Examples

```bash
# Create a new task in inbox using natural language processing
tod -t Buy milk from the grocery store tomorrow p1

# Create a task in a project
tod -p myproject -t write more rust \\ with a description

# Get the next task for a project
tod -np myproject

# Complete the last "next task" and get another
tod -c && tod -np myproject

# Get your work schedule
tod -ep work
```

### Why I made this

I am a developer who uses Todoist to reduce stress and cognitive overhead, by delegating things that a machine does well to a machine. This CLI application scratches some very specific itches for me, and I hope that it may be of use to others as well!

Some points around my general strategy:

- Do one thing at a time, multi-tasking is an illusion (see `--next`)
- Capture all tasks immediately with the inbox and add detail later (see `--task`)
- Use prioritize and sort to batch process the inbox infrequently (see `--prioritize` and `--sort`)
- Make all your tasks "actions", concrete tasks that can be acted on. Add phone numbers, hyperlinks etc to your tasks
- Batch process like things as infrequently as possible to lower context switching, i.e. clear your email inbox once per day, spam once per week.
- Remember that the objective is to **get the important things done with less friction**, not just get more things done.
- Further to the above point, make sure to leave yourself margin. It is in the spaces between the periouds work that we recover and get our best ideas.
- Less projects is better than more projects
- Use projects as "modes" where you only work in one at a time
- Don't put a date on it unless it needs to be done that day
- Don't put a time on it unless it is an appointment with yourself or others
