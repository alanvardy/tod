# Motivation

I am a developer who uses Todoist to reduce stress and cognitive overhead, by delegating things that a machine does well to a machine. This CLI application scratches some very specific itches for me, and I hope that it may be of use to others as well!

Some points around my general strategy:

- Do one thing at a time, multitasking is an illusion (see `tod project process`)
- Capture all tasks immediately with the inbox and add detail later (see `tod project empty`, `schedule`, and `prioritize`)
- Make all your tasks "actions", concrete tasks that can be acted on. Add phone numbers, hyperlinks etc. to your tasks
- Batch process like things as infrequently as possible to lower context switching, i.e. clear your email inbox once per day, spam once per week.
- Remember that the objective is to **get the important things done with less friction**, not just get more things done.
- Further to the above point, make sure to leave yourself margin. It is in the spaces between the periods work that we recover and get our best ideas.
- Fewer projects are better than more projects
- Use projects as "modes" where you only work in one at a time
